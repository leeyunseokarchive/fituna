"""fituna.search
================

The core orchestrator: quality-first filtering over ``quant_candidates``
(highest quality first), grid search over ``ctx_candidates``, binary search
over ``ngl`` (bounded by ``ngl_max_calls``), with early-exit as soon as a
candidate meets both the target throughput and the quality-loss ceiling.

Algorithm (implemented below, matches the spec's two-stage design):

Stage 1 -- quality pre-filter (one ``llama-perplexity`` call per quant):
    baseline_ppl is computed once (and cached) on the unquantized base GGUF.
    Each quant is quantized (idempotent) and its quality_loss_pct measured;
    quants whose loss exceeds ``max_quality_loss_pct`` are skipped entirely
    (early-exit A) -- they never reach the benchmarking stage.

Stage 2 -- speed search, walking quants in quality-descending order:
    - top = bench at ngl=n_layers (max offload). If even that misses the
      target throughput, this quant can't work at any ngl -- skip to the
      next, lower-quality (often faster) quant (early-exit B).
    - if hardware has a GPU, low = bench at ngl=0. If that alone already
      meets the target, no GPU offload is needed -- adopt it immediately
      (early-exit C), skipping the binary search entirely.
    - otherwise binary-search the minimal ngl in [0, n_layers] that meets
      the target (<= ngl_max_calls calls), assuming gen_tok_per_sec is
      monotonically non-decreasing in ngl (documented assumption; the worst
      case if it's violated is simply falling back to the already-known-good
      `top` result, so this stays safe).
    - any extra ctx_candidates are re-verified at the winning ngl.
    - the first quant (in quality order) that produces a working candidate
      wins immediately -- lower-quality quants are never tried.

If no quant/ngl/ctx combination meets the target, the loop naturally
exhausts and :class:`~fituna.config.NoFeasibleConfigError` is raised,
carrying the best (fastest) attempt seen as ``closest`` if any benchmark
ran at all. If the search is cut short by ``target.max_bench_seconds``
instead, the best-effort result is returned normally with
``meets_target=False`` (a time-out is not proof of infeasibility, so it
does not raise).

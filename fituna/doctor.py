"""fituna.doctor
================

Environment self-diagnosis for ``fituna doctor``. Runs a fixed battery of
checks -- Python version, llama.cpp binaries, llama.cpp version, hardware
detection, output directory writability, and free disk space -- and reports
each as PASS/WARN/FAIL with a one-line remedy for anything short of PASS.

Why this exists: today ``fituna run`` only reveals what is missing once it
fails partway through a search, with a message scoped to whatever step broke.
A third party running FiTuna for the first time (e.g. a competition judging
agency working from the docs alone) needs a single command that tells them,
up front and precisely, what is missing and how to fix it.

Never raises: every individual check is guarded (see ``_safe``) so a bug in
one check can only ever turn into a FAIL row for that check -- it can never
abort the rest of the diagnosis or crash the process. A diagnostic tool that
crashes mid-diagnosis is worse than useless for a user with no other context.

Binary discovery: the three required binaries (llama-quantize/llama-bench/
llama-perplexity), plus llama-cli (which ``fituna.binaries`` does not model
at all; see its own module docstring), are each looked up individually via
``fituna.binaries.find_exe()`` -- the same single-binary lookup
``fituna.binaries.locate_binaries()`` itself uses internally, reused rather
than re-wrapped. Checking one binary at a time (rather than delegating to
``locate_binaries()``, which is all-or-nothing by contract) is what lets a
FAIL row say *which* binary is missing. Version detection -- the one piece
of real, non-trivial logic in this area, with its regex-based probing of
--version/--help across binaries and llama.cpp release eras -- is reused via
``fituna.binaries.get_llama_cpp_version()`` unconditionally, never
duplicated.

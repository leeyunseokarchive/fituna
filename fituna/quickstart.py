"""fituna.quickstart
===================

The ``fituna quickstart`` interactive wizard: an ``input()``-based shell over
capabilities that are *all* reachable non-interactively through ``fituna
run``'s public flags. It ends by printing the fully assembled ``fituna run
...`` command and then executing it in-process through the very same code
path ``fituna/cli.py`` dispatches to -- the wizard graduates its users to the
CLI rather than becoming a second, divergent interface.

**Every search parameter maps to a public ``run`` flag.** Every answer that
feeds the search (target speed, quality-loss ceiling, ctx, license filter)
turns into one ``fituna run`` argument (see :func:`build_run_argv`);
``_selfcheck`` and the tests both parse that argv back through
``cli._build_parser()`` and assert it is exactly the argv actually executed,
so a search parameter this wizard could express but ``run`` cannot fails
immediately instead of quietly forking the product. Model download (the
curated shortlist, HuggingFace search) is a wizard convenience with no
``run`` equivalent -- ``run --model`` still expects a ``.gguf`` already on
disk.

The honesty line this module has to embody
------------------------------------------
- **Memory fit is arithmetic and is allowed**: published file size vs the
  VRAM/RAM ``fituna.hardware`` detected (:func:`memory_fit`), with the
  assumed margin spelled out on screen (``_MEMORY_CAVEAT``).
- **Speed is never predicted.** The wizard says so in its own visible copy.
  Numbers from ``docs/RESULTS.md`` appear only as *records of past
  measurements on named hardware*, never as a forecast for the user's box.
- **License provenance is never laundered.** The three curated models carry a
  "라이선스 원문 확인됨" badge because this project checked their license text
  (``docs/AI_MODEL_USAGE.md`` B-1/B-2/B-3). Everything coming out of HF search
  is labelled uploader-supplied metadata, with the uploader's own link.
- **Preset targets are conventional starting points**, labelled as such --
  the search is what judges them.

HuggingFace search API -- verified by hand against the live API on
2026-08-02, not guessed, same practice as ``fituna/corpus.py``:

    GET https://huggingface.co/api/models
        ?search=<q>&filter=gguf&limit=<n>&sort=downloads&direction=-1
        &expand[]=cardData&expand[]=gated&expand[]=downloads
        &expand[]=siblings&expand[]=tags

    -> 200 [ {"id": "LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-4.0-32B-GGUF",
              "cardData": {"license": "other", "license_name": "exaone",
                           "license_link": "LICENSE", ...},
              "gated": false, "downloads": 81725,
              "tags": [..., "license:other", ...],
              "siblings": [{"rfilename": "EXAONE-4.0-32B-Q4_K_M.gguf"}, ...]},
            ... ]

Confirmed characteristics that shaped the parser:
- The response is a bare JSON *array*, not an object with a "models" key.
- There is **no top-level ``license`` field**. The license lives in
  ``cardData.license``; when that is the literal string ``"other"`` the real
  name is in ``cardData.license_name`` (EXAONE reports ``license: "other"`` +
  ``license_name: "exaone"``, Kanana ``license_name:
  "kanana-open-license"``) -- reading only ``cardData.license`` would file
  every research-only license under the meaningless label "other". A
  ``license:<slug>`` entry also appears in ``tags`` and is used as a fallback.
- ``cardData`` may be present with no ``license`` key at all (e.g.
  ``mradermacher/EXAONE-4.0-1.2B-abliterated-i1-GGUF`` in the captured
  fixture, whose ``cardData`` carries only ``base_model``/``tags``) --
  "no license metadata" is a real case, not an edge case. ``cardData`` being
  *absent entirely* is covered separately, by the synthetic
  ``someone/Model-GGUF`` row in ``_selfcheck`` (no ``cardData`` key at all,
  license recovered from the ``tags`` fallback instead).
- ``gated`` is ``false`` or a *string* (``"manual"``/``"auto"``, observed on
  ``meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf``), so it is truthiness-tested, not
  compared to ``True``.
- ``siblings`` lists every file in the repo as ``{"rfilename": ...}``; the
  ``.gguf`` entries are the only downloadable candidates, and multi-part
  shards appear as ``...-00001-of-00002.gguf``.
- ``expand[]`` and the default listing are both accepted without auth or a
  custom User-Agent; ``full=true`` returns the same fields except
  ``cardData``, which is why ``expand[]`` is used instead.

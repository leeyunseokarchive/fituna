"""fituna.errors
================

Re-exports the :class:`FiTunaError` hierarchy from :mod:`fituna.config`.

The exceptions are defined once, in ``config.py``, alongside the rest of the
interface contract (single source of truth for cross-module types). This
module exists only so ``from fituna.errors import ...`` reads naturally from
call sites that only care about error handling, not the data model.

# this file is a pure re-export shim, not a second definition site.
# Every other module in this package imports the exceptions straight from
# fituna.config (the contract), so nothing here can drift out of sync with
# it -- there is exactly one class body for each exception, in config.py.
# Duplicating the class definitions here would violate the "single source
# of truth" rule stated in the interface contract and risk two copies that
# compare unequal via isinstance/except across modules.
